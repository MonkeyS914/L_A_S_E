Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

|Symbol|Value|
|:-:|:-:|
|I |1|
|V|5|
|X|10|
|L|50|
|C|100|
|D|500|
|M|1000|

For example, two is written as **II** in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, **XII**, which is simply **X** + **II**. The number twenty seven is written as **XXVII**, which is **XX** + **V** + **II**.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not **IIII**. Instead, the number four is written as **IV**. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as **IX**. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* **I** can be placed before **V** (5) and **X** (10) to make 4 and 9. 
* **X** can be placed before **L** (50) and **C** (100) to make 40 and 90. 
* **C** can be placed before **D** (500) and **M** (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

#####Example 1:

>Input: "III"
>
>Output: 3

#####Example 2:

>Input: "IV"
>
>Output: 4

#####Example 3:

>Input: "IX"
>
>Output: 9

#####Example 4:

>Input: "LVIII"
>
>Output: 58
>
>Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

#####Example 5:

>Input: "MCMXCIV"
>
>Output: 1994
>
>Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

#####Solution 1

```
public class Solution {
    public int RomanToInt(string s) {
        int ret = 0;
        Dictionary<char, int> RomanDic = new Dictionary<char, int>(){
            {'I',1},
            {'V',5},
            {'X',10},
            {'L',50},
            {'C',100},
            {'D',500},
            {'M',1000}
        };
        
        ret = RomanDic[s[s.Length-1]];
        
        for(int i = s.Length - 1; i>0; i--){
            if(RomanDic[s[i]] > RomanDic[s[i-1]])
                ret -= RomanDic[s[i-1]];
            else
                ret += RomanDic[s[i-1]];
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```

归纳总结罗马数字的计算方法，实际上无论是从前往后遍历还是从后往前遍历，都是一样的。

比较左右两个数的大小，确定是加法还是减法；

以从后往前遍历为例，第一个数字一定是被加到结果中的；

比较倒数第二个数字与倒数第一个的大小，确定是减法还是加法；

一次计算，得到最后的结果
